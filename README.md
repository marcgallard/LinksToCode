# BMI Calculator - 9-15-22
Created as a solution for a given programming problem, this script takes in a BMI table, patients' basic health data, and calculates their BMI as well as a qualitative score according to the given BMI table. Data is processed in JSON format with some tests included to ensure functionality. Problem can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcgallard/LinksToCode/main/images/Screenshot%20from%202022-11-02%2022-08-42.png) with my code in [this separate repo](https://github.com/marcgallard/code-20220915-marcogallardo) (title of repo had to meet a specific format).

# EONET Event Visualizer - 4-24-23
I was looking around for free datasets and stumbled upon NASA's Open APIs, specifically EONET API. I've never played around with geospatial data and had limited experience with geopandas so I decided to try my hand at visualizing the Events data using Tableau Public. My code for accomplishing this project can be found [here](https://github.com/marcgallard/EONETEventVisualizer). I've included the data I grabbed using the API and its homogenized version for Tableau purposes; refer to the repo's README for more info.
